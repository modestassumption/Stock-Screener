# Stock Screener
 Analysing data from NSE and BSE stocks to derive values and draw meanings to it, while also back testing trading strategies using 26 years of data.
 
 >Under progress :)

 Using Tickerdata.py, we find ticker names listed on the [Official NSE Website](https://www.nseindia.com/) and download it as a csv document using '''selenium''', your Chrome browser might open for a bit but please don't mind it. 
> Will also add data regarding unlisted tickers on yfinance.

 Screener will read the downloaded csv and find data for the listed tickers, put them on a dictionary, and analyze it, bringing graphs and precision values.
