# Stock Screener
 Analysing data from NSE and BSE stocks to derive values and draw meanings to it, while also back testing trading strategies using 26 years of data.

 Using Tickerdata.py, we find ticker names listed on the [Official NSE Website](https://www.nseindia.com/) and download it as a csv document using '''selenium''', your Chrome browser might open for a bit but please don't mind it. 
> Will also add data regarding unlisted tickers on yfinance.

 Screener will read the downloaded csv and find data for the listed tickers, put them on a dictionary, and analyze it, bringing graphs and precision values.
